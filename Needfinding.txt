Indoor positioning systems help in the localisation of objects or spaces inside a building, where Global Positioning System doesn't work effectively. We have lot of outdoor navigation applications already in use which help us when lost in the outdoor places. But there are times when we get lost inside big spaces/buildings like airports, malls, etc. Hence, there is a need for indoor navigation applications and there are only a limited number of them in use today with limited features. Navigate is an indoor navigation app developed by our team, to overcome this and facilitate easy movement at indoor spaces.
